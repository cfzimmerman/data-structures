# data-structures
TypeScript has many strengths, but built-in data structures are not one of them. For my own use (and for fun ðŸ˜„), I've created the common generic data structures saved in this repo. Feel free to use or adapt them for your own purposes, and please reach out to me if you'd like to suggest a more-optimal way to implement something. (my email can be found at cfzimmerman.com)
